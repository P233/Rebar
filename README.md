# Rebar Grid Framework

Rebar is aimed to make responsive development more efficient and keep CSS organised. The idea is to setup a list of breakpoints and assign container or grid settings for each breakpoint at one time. It use `padding` for gutter, works the same way as Bootstrap 3 grid system does. So if you already familiar with Bootstrap, you will find Rebar is easy to use and far more flexible.

Rebar requires Sass 3.4 or Stylus and is incompatible with Libsass 3.1.
